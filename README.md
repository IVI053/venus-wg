Victron added wireguard kernel drivers with Version 3.20 of Venus OS.
Wireguard-tools are also provided with opkg since then.
This makes connections with wireguard easier, but some configuration
is still needed to get everything up and running.

In this repo I want to provide a collection of stuff I did to get
everything going.
